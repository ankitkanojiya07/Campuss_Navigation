# Campuss_Navigation
The campus navigation project aims to develop a system that provides efficient navigation and guidance for users within a campus environment. The project's primary goal is to help students, faculty, and visitors easily navigate the campus, locate buildings, find specific rooms or facilities, and discover points of interest.

Here we used videos to navigate to peoples by voice. And we uploaded these videos on YouTube and generated a QR and paste this qr everywhere on the campus.
